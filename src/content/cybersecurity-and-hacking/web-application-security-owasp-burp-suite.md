# Web Application Security (OWASP, Burp Suite)

## **Web Application Security (OWASP, Burp Suite) Mastery Roadmap**

This **detailed roadmap** will take you from **beginner to expert** in **Web Application Security**, covering **OWASP vulnerabilities, penetration testing, security tools, Burp Suite, and real-world exploitation techniques**.

***

### **Phase 1: Web Security Fundamentals**

âœ… **Introduction to Web Application Security**

* What is Web Security? Understanding Threat Models
* How Web Applications Work: HTTP, HTTPS, Requests & Responses
* Security Testing Methodologies (Black Box, Gray Box, White Box)

âœ… **Understanding OWASP Top 10**

* Injection Attacks (SQLi, NoSQLi, Command Injection)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) & Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Security Misconfigurations & Insecure Deserialization
* Broken Authentication & Session Management
* API Security Risks (Broken Object Level Authorization)

ðŸ“Œ **Mini Projects:**

* **Analyze and Mitigate an XSS Attack in a Test Environment**
* **Set Up a Basic Web Application and Identify Security Flaws**

***

### **Phase 2: Hands-on with Burp Suite & Security Tools**

âœ… **Getting Started with Burp Suite**

* Setting Up Burp Suite (Community vs. Professional)
* Intercepting HTTP Traffic & Modifying Requests
* Using Burp Scanner for Automated Testing

âœ… **Manual Exploitation & Proxying**

* Fuzzing Inputs for Injection Attacks
* Exploiting Authentication & Authorization Issues
* Identifying API Vulnerabilities with Burp Suite

ðŸ“Œ **Mini Projects:**

* **Perform SQL Injection Using Burp Suite's Repeater Tool**
* **Manually Find an Authentication Bypass in a Test Application**

***

### **Phase 3: Advanced Web Security Testing**

âœ… **Server-Side & API Security Testing**

* Exploiting Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
* Bypassing Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)
* API Security Testing: OAuth, JWT, Rate-Limiting Bypasses

âœ… **Advanced Vulnerability Discovery**

* HTTP Request Smuggling
* Exploiting Business Logic Flaws
* Web Cache Poisoning Attacks

ðŸ“Œ **Mini Projects:**

* **Bypass Authentication Using JWT Manipulation**
* **Perform an SSRF Attack in a Test Environment**

***

### **Phase 4: Web Security Automation & Real-World Practice**

âœ… **Automating Security Testing**

* Using Nuclei for Automated Vulnerability Scanning
* Writing Custom Burp Suite Extensions
* Automating Recon & Security Testing with Python

âœ… **Bug Hunting & Real-World Exploits**

* Finding Security Issues in Open Source Applications
* Hunting for Web Vulnerabilities in Bug Bounty Programs
* Reporting Security Flaws Professionally

ðŸ“Œ **Mini Projects:**

* **Write a Python Script to Automate SQL Injection Testing**
* **Perform a Full Security Audit on a Self-Deployed Web App**

***

### **Phase 5: Best Practices & Career Growth**

âœ… **Security Best Practices & Hardening Techniques**

* Secure Coding Practices & Input Validation
* Content Security Policy (CSP) & Security Headers
* Secure API Development & OAuth Implementation

âœ… **Final Projects & Career Path**

* **Complete a Web Application Security Report**
* **Contribute to Open Source Security Tools**
* **Join Bug Bounty Platforms (HackerOne, BugCrowd, Intigriti)**

***

### **Final Step: Real-World Practice & Skill Testing**

ðŸ”¥ **Platforms to Test & Improve Skills:**

* [OWASP Juice Shop](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/) _(Deliberately vulnerable web app for practice)_
* [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.com/) _(Penetration testing labs)_
* [PortSwigger Web Security Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security) _(Burp Suite training & labs)_

ðŸš€ **By mastering this roadmap, youâ€™ll be able to:**\
âœ… **Identify & Exploit Web Vulnerabilities Professionally**\
âœ… **Secure Web Applications Against Real-World Attacks**\
âœ… **Become a Penetration Tester or Bug Bounty Hunter**

ðŸ”¥ **Start hacking ethically and securing the web!**
