# Network Penetration Testing

## **Network Penetration Testing Mastery Roadmap**

This **detailed roadmap** will take you from **beginner to expert** in **Network Penetration Testing**, covering **network security, scanning, exploitation, post-exploitation, and real-world attack simulations**.

***

### **Phase 1: Networking & Security Fundamentals**

âœ… **Understanding Network Basics**

* OSI & TCP/IP Models
* IP Addressing, Subnetting, and CIDR Notation
* DNS, DHCP, ARP, and ICMP Protocols
* Understanding Firewalls, VPNs, and Proxies

âœ… **Introduction to Network Security**

* Network Threats & Attack Vectors
* Common Network Security Misconfigurations
* Network Monitoring & Logging Basics

ðŸ“Œ **Mini Projects:**

* **Set Up a Virtual Lab with Multiple Networked Machines**
* **Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark**

***

### **Phase 2: Network Reconnaissance & Scanning**

âœ… **Passive & Active Reconnaissance**

* OSINT Techniques for Network Discovery
* Using Shodan, Censys, and WHOIS for Target Enumeration

âœ… **Network Scanning & Mapping**

* Nmap for Host Discovery, Service Enumeration, and OS Fingerprinting
* Identifying Open Ports & Services
* Banner Grabbing & Network Fingerprinting

ðŸ“Œ **Mini Projects:**

* **Perform Network Reconnaissance on a Test Environment**
* **Map Out a Network Using Nmap and Visualize the Results**

***

### **Phase 3: Network Exploitation & Attacks**

âœ… **Exploiting Network Vulnerabilities**

* ARP Spoofing & MITM Attacks
* DNS Poisoning & Redirection Attacks
* Exploiting Unpatched Services (SMB, FTP, RDP, SNMP)

âœ… **Wireless Network Attacks**

* Cracking WEP/WPA2 Networks Using Aircrack-ng
* Rogue Access Points & Evil Twin Attacks
* Deauthentication Attacks & Packet Injection

ðŸ“Œ **Mini Projects:**

* **Perform an ARP Spoofing Attack in a Lab**
* **Crack a WPA2 Wi-Fi Network in a Test Environment**

***

### **Phase 4: Post-Exploitation & Lateral Movement**

âœ… **Post-Exploitation Techniques**

* Extracting Password Hashes & Cracking Them
* Privilege Escalation Techniques (Windows & Linux)
* Pivoting & Lateral Movement Across a Network

âœ… **Maintaining Access & Persistence**

* Creating Backdoors & Remote Access Tools
* Evading IDS/IPS & Firewall Restrictions

ðŸ“Œ **Mini Projects:**

* **Compromise a Machine and Escalate Privileges**
* **Use SSH Tunneling for Persistent Access**

***

### **Phase 5: Network Security Hardening & Red Teaming**

âœ… **Defensive Techniques & Network Hardening**

* Implementing Proper Network Segmentation
* Secure Firewall Configurations & IDS/IPS Deployment
* Securing Wireless Networks & VPN Implementations

âœ… **Red Team & Advanced Attack Simulations**

* Conducting Full Network Penetration Tests
* Evading Security Mechanisms (SIEM, Firewalls, EDR)
* Writing Custom Exploits & Payloads

ðŸ“Œ **Mini Projects:**

* **Simulate a Full Red Team Attack on a Virtual Network**
* **Implement Security Measures and Test Their Effectiveness**

***

### **Phase 6: Real-World Testing & Career Growth**

âœ… **Real-World Network Penetration Testing**

* Writing Professional Network Pentest Reports
* Adhering to Legal & Ethical Hacking Standards (OSCP, CEH, etc.)
* Gaining Experience in Corporate Environments

âœ… **Final Projects & Certifications**

* **Perform a Full Network Pentest on a Simulated Enterprise Network**
* **Earn Certifications (OSCP, PNPT, CEH, CISSP)**

***

### **Final Step: Real-World Practice & Skill Testing**
