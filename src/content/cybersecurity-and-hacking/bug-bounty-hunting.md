# Bug Bounty Hunting

## Bug Bounty Hunting Mastery Roadmap

This **detailed roadmap** will take you from **beginner to expert** in **Bug Bounty Hunting**, covering **reconnaissance, vulnerability identification, exploitation, reporting, and real-world practice**.

***

### Phase 1: Fundamentals of Bug Bounty Hunting

#### ✅ Introduction to Bug Bounty Hunting

* What is Bug Bounty Hunting? Legal Aspects & Ethics
* How Bug Bounty Platforms Work (HackerOne, BugCrowd, Intigriti, Open Bug Bounty)
* Understanding Responsible Disclosure & Private Programs

#### ✅ Essential Web & Networking Knowledge

* HTTP Protocol (Requests, Responses, Headers, Status Codes)
* Cookies, Sessions, and Authentication Mechanisms
* DNS, Subdomains, and CDN Behavior

📌 **Mini Projects:**

* **Analyze HTTP requests and responses using Burp Suite**
* **Map out a website’s structure and endpoints manually**

***

### Phase 2: Reconnaissance & Information Gathering

#### ✅ Passive Reconnaissance

* Google Dorking & OSINT Techniques
* Finding Sensitive Information in Public Repositories (GitHub, Pastebin)
* Discovering Subdomains (`Subfinder`, `Amass`, `Assetfinder`)

#### ✅ Active Reconnaissance

* Port Scanning & Service Enumeration (`Nmap`, `Masscan`)
* Web Technology Fingerprinting (`WhatWeb`, `Wappalyzer`)
* Directory & File Bruteforcing (`dirb`, `dirsearch`, `ffuf`)

📌 **Mini Projects:**

* **Automate subdomain enumeration using OSINT tools**
* **Create a custom recon script using Python or Bash**

***

### Phase 3: Web Application Security & Exploitation

#### ✅ Understanding OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities

* SQL Injection (`SQLMap`, Manual SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (`XSSer`, `BeEF`)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
* Security Misconfigurations

#### ✅ Advanced Web Exploitation

* HTTP Request Smuggling
* API Security & Token Manipulation
* Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)
* Business Logic & Authorization Bypasses

📌 **Mini Projects:**

* **Exploit SQL Injection on a test website**
* **Manually find and exploit an XSS vulnerability**

***

### Phase 4: Advanced Hunting & Bug Discovery Techniques

#### ✅ Real-World Bug Hunting Strategies

* Understanding How Companies Secure Their Applications
* Hunting for IDOR (Insecure Direct Object References)
* Chaining Multiple Vulnerabilities for Impact

#### ✅ Automating Recon & Bug Hunting

* Using Nuclei for Automated Vulnerability Scanning
* Writing Custom Burp Suite Extensions
* Automating Bug Hunting Workflows with Bash & Python

📌 **Mini Projects:**

* **Create a custom vulnerability scanner with Python**
* **Write automation scripts for bug bounty recon**

***

### Phase 5: Reporting & Earning from Bug Bounties

#### ✅ Writing Professional Bug Reports

* How to Structure a Bug Report
* Providing Proof of Concept (PoC) Videos & Screenshots
* Avoiding Duplicate & Low-Quality Reports

#### ✅ Scaling Up Bug Bounty Earnings

* Targeting Private Bug Bounty Programs
* Joining Security Research Communities
* Balancing Automation & Manual Testing

📌 **Mini Projects:**

* **Submit a well-documented report to a bug bounty platform**
* **Write a research blog on a discovered vulnerability**

***

### Final Step: Real-World Testing & Practice

🔥 **Bug Bounty Platforms to Practice:**
